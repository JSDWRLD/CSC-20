# CSC-20 Advanced Java

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic pursuits in CSC 20.

- **Lab 1: The Oracle Algorithm**
  - Description: Delve into the mystical realms of Java programming as you construct an algorithmic oracle that conjures responses from a text-file-based array, imparting wisdom through randomized revelations.

- **Lab 2: Integer Manifestation**
  - Description: Embark on a structured exploration of integer tokenization within the realm of file input-output operations, as you diligently assemble and display numeric tokens within an array.

- **Lab 3: Visual Abstraction**
  - Description: Engage in a creative synthesis of graphical abstraction within a two-dimensional interface, reminiscent of the avant-garde Etch-A-Sketch paradigm, exploring the bounds of visual representation through random strokes of algorithmic creativity.

- **Lab 4: Object-oriented Composition**
  - Description: Embark on a symphonic journey through object-oriented composition, orchestrating the manipulation and arrangement of Student objects within a harmonious ArrayList ensemble.

- **Lab 5: Inheritance**
  - Descritpion: This lab was meant to practice debugging and the use of inheritance and polymorphism
 
- **Lab 6: Untitled**
  - Descritpion: 
     
- **Assignment 1: Cartographic Inquiry**
  - Description: Navigate the intricate pathways of Java programming as you undertake the construction of a comprehensive shopping cart system, facilitating seamless item addition and removal within an array-based framework.

- **Assignment 2 (Locked): Parcel Dynamics**
  - Description: Explore the intricacies of object-oriented inheritance as you unlock the secrets of class composition, crafting TwoDayPackage and OverNightPackage entities that dynamically inherit and extend each other's functionality.
